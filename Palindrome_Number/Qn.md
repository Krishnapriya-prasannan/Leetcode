##  Problem Description

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome integer, and `false` otherwise.

A palindrome number reads the same backward as forward.

---

##  Examples

**Example 1:**
```

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads the same forward and backward.

```

**Example 2:**
```

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: Reads as -121 forward but 121- backward, so not a palindrome.

```

**Example 3:**
```

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads as 10 forward and 01 backward, so not a palindrome.

```

## Constraints

- `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`
