##  Problem Description

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

##  Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**  
`height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`  
**Output:**  
`6`  
**Explanation:**  
The elevation map traps **6 units** of water in total (represented as blue sections in a bar graph).

### Example 2

**Input:**  
`height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]`  
**Output:**  
`9`  
**Explanation:**  
A total of **9 units** of rain water can be trapped.

##  Constraints

- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10⁴`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10⁵`
