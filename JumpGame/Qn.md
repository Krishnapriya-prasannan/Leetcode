##  Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the first index of the array.  
Each element in the array represents your **maximum jump length** at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

##  Examples

**Example 1:**
```

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

```

**Example 2:**
```

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its max jump length is 0, so you can't move forward.

```

##  Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
