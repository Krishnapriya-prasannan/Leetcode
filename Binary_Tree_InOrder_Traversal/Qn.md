##  Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

**LeetCode Problem Link:**
 [94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

---

###  Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the **inorder traversal** of its nodes' values.

> **Inorder Traversal Order:**
> Left → Node → Right

---

###  Examples

#### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]
Output: [4,2,6,5,7,1,3,9,8]
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

#### Example 4:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

###  Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range **\[0, 100]**.
* Node values are in the range **\[-100, 100]**.

###  Follow-Up

> The **recursive** solution is trivial. Can you solve it **iteratively**?
