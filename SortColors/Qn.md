##  Problem Description

You are given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored **red**, **white**, or **blue**, represented by integers:

- `0` â†’ red  
- `1` â†’ white  
- `2` â†’ blue  

Sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order: **red â†’ white â†’ blue**.

You must solve this without using the library's sort function.

##  Examples

### Example 1  
**Input:**  
`nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]`  
**Output:**  
`[0,0,1,1,2,2]`

### Example 2  
**Input:**  
`nums = [2,0,1]`  
**Output:**  
`[0,1,2]`

##  Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`
```
