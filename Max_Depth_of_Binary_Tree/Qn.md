###  **Maximum Depth of Binary Tree**

 **LeetCode Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree)

---

###  **Problem Statement**

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *its maximum depth*.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

###  **Examples**

#### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
Explanation:
        3
       / \
      9  20
         / \
        15  7
The longest path is: 3 → 20 → 15 (or 3 → 20 → 7), which has depth = 3.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:

      2
```

### **Constraints**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range **\[0, 10⁴]**.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
