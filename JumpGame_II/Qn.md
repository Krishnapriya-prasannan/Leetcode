#  Jump Game II — Greedy Linear Solution

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

##  Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the **maximum length of a forward jump** from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

```

0 <= j <= nums\[i] and i + j < n

```

Return the **minimum number of jumps** to reach `nums[n - 1]`.  
The test cases are generated such that **you can always reach the last index**.

###  Examples

#### Example 1:
```

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2

Explanation:
Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

```

#### Example 2:
```

Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2

##  Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁴`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- It is guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.
